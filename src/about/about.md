DataJoint Elements, DataJoint documentation, and DataJoint Web GUIs and APIs are supported by the NIH grant [**NIH U24 NS116470**](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10547509) for disseminating open-source software for neuroscience research.

The goal is to systematize and disseminate data pipeline designs from leading neuroscience projects using the DataJoint framework.

### Aim 1: DataJoint Pipelines for Neurophysiology

Extract and systematize essential design motifs from published DataJoint-based projects as a collection of simple modules.

### Aim 2: Access and Training Resources

Support a dedicated resource for accessing and using DataJoint Pipelines for Neurophysiology.
